Overview:
The arcade consists of multiple games: Tetris, Snake, Manual, Multiplayer, and smart Flappy Bird
All the game classes share the same timeline and same pause method.

The classes in the evolution package interact in the following:
-The app class
    contains instance of the arcade class. It adds the root to the scene and sets the stage
-The Arcade class:
    -the top-level graphic class for all the game classes. It organizes the panes graphically
    -this is where the shared gamePane, timeline, and buttonPane are created
-The FlappyBird class:
    -the top-level logic class for the different flappy bird modes
    it creates the handleKeypress, gameOver and restart methods, which are then called in the arcade class,
    -it tracks the bird's score, which increases by 1 for each pipe the bird passes through
    -The differentMode enum is instantiated here so the game doesn't know about which flappyBird mode it is currently in
-The ManualBird class:
    -this is a wrapper class the wraps around two javafx shapes-Circle and Polygon
    -it creates the composite shape of the bird
    -To enhance loose coupling in the program, all the methods associated with the movement and velocity of the bird are
    implemented here
-The multiplayerBird class:
    -creates two instance of the manualBird class because it needs to operate just like the regular flappyBird
-The smartBird class:'
    -contains one instance of then manualBird class.
    -Contains an instance of the neural network because we want each smart bird to have its own neural network
    -Calls the forward propagation and makes the smart bird jump or not jump based on the outcome of the output node
-The population class:
    -contains instance of the smart Bird class
    first creates 50 smart birds with random weights and for each subsequent generation, the weights of the 3 best performing
    birds are passed down to the next generation. The weights of the children are then mutates so that they learn over time
-The Pipe class:
    this is a wrapper class that contains a javafx class-rectangle
    in this class, two rectangles are created--the top and bottom pipes.
-The pipeManager:
    Contains instance of the pipe class
    handles the generating, scrolling and the deleting of the pipes
-The Constants class:
   - To make the program  more understandable, we created a constants class that contains all the constants used in the program.
    This reduces repetition of numbers in the program and also improves the general design of the program.

Design choices:
2 interfaces: Playable and Flappable
    All the game classes implement the playable interface, which declares the restart, gameOver, updateGame, and handleKeyPress method.
    I used an interface because all the game classes have those methods listed above but they define it differently.
    The bird classes(Manual, Multiplayer, smart) also implement an interface called flappable, which declares the gameOVer, updateWithTimeline
    and handleKeyPress methods.
Containment:
 I used containment in our program to add a high level osf abstraction and delegation to our program.
 -The App class contains the arcade class
 -The smartBird and multiplayerBird classes contain the ManualBird class
 -The smartBird class contains the NeuralNetwork class
 -The population class contains an instance of the smartBird class
 -The pipeManager class contains the pipe class
Association:
-I associated the gamePane with all the game classes and all the different flappy bird modes
-I associated the timeline with all the game classes
-I associated the pipeManager class with all the different flappy bird modes because they all need to know about the pipes
to check for collision.
-I associated the scorePane with the population class to add the stats of the smart birds

Enums:
   I created three different enums to delegate the work more and make the program more extensible
-SpeedLevel Enum:
    it sets the speed of the timeline based on the enum value
-Game Enum:
    In this enum, I instantiated the different game classes in enum to make it extensible to add other arcade games.
    This creates a level of abstraction because the arcade class doesn't need to know about which game is currently playing
-DifferentModes:
    I instantiated the different flappy bird modes in this enum
    this creates a level of abstraction so that the game class doesn't know about which mode it is in while the game progresses

Constructor Overloading:
    -I used constructor overloading because sometimes I wanted to create birds with random weights and other times
    I wanted to initialize the birds with the neural network of a parent.
Bells and whistles:
    -Some fun colors on the birds
    -styled the arcade home screen
